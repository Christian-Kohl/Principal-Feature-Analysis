# Principal-Feature-Analysis (PFA)

This is a fork of another github repo, I am adapting it for academic use, the original can be found here:
https://github.com/LauritzR/Principal-Feature-Analysis

Note from the original authors of the paper:

If you use the presented PFA method or the provided Python scripts inspired you for further extensions or variations of this framework, we’ll be happy if you cite our paper “A principal feature analysis” (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2021.101502) in course of which the Python implementations of this git repository have been worked out.
